# What is this project?
**QusCrypt** is a tool for encrypting and decrypting text with a multitude of different ciphers, as well as a set of custom ciphers made by me.

# Usage
Launch any of the jars in the build directory with
```
java -jar QusCrypt-x.x.jar
```
Note: you also need the English dictionary to be in the same folder as the jar.
Further instructions can be found by executing the "help" command.
